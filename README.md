# Multi-Class-Chest-Disease-Classification

This study presents an enhanced system for the automated diagnosis of multiple chest
diseases through multi-class image classification. It applies transfer learning by taking a
pre-trained convolutional neural network and fine-tuning it on a chest X-ray dataset to
enhance disease recognition accuracy. To further improve the model’s generalization and
performance, methods like dropout, learning rate scheduling, and early stopping are used
during training. Moreover, Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) is
employed to produce visual explanations, demonstrating the regions on the X-ray that
impacted the model’s outputs. This enhances the interpretability and credibility of the
system and makes it an effective aid to medical professionals to make quicker and more
precise diagnoses.
